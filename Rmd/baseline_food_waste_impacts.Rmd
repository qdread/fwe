Here are some plots I just made using output from the USEEIO model combined with FAO food waste data. They are made using two scenarios: the "baseline" environmental impact of the food system, and the counterfactual environmental impact of the food system with all food waste set to zero. I assume that the difference in impact between the two = the impact contained in food that is wasted, regardless of where along the supply chain it is wasted.

I made two sets of figures: one that splits up the impacts by stage, and one that splits it up by food type. Note that we are dealing with *direct* impacts here. The beauty of the input-output model is that it integrates the impacts across all activities in the economy, but if we are interested in specifically teasing out individual stages, we need to look at their direct impacts. Clearly, much of the resource use in the food system in terms of land, water, and other physical inputs is in the agricultural stage. Therefore, many of the by-stage figures show high direct impacts of agricultural production but relatively less for other stages. As always, keep in mind the principle of increasing embodied impacts as an item passes further down the supply chain. For the goal of food waste reduction, it is not as important where the direct impacts are generated because reducing waste later in the chain can decrease impacts by requiring less production further up the chain.

# Impacts by stage 

Here, we can identify direct impacts from economic activities related to (1) agricultural production, (2) food processing, (3) distribution and retail, (4a) full-service and fast food portions of the foodservice industry, and (4b) institutional foodservice. The remaining impacts are indirect impacts which implicitly include impacts resulting from household consumption, but it is difficult at this point to specifically isolate household impacts.

In all figures, the total height of the bar represents the total impact, and the lighter shaded area denotes impacts due to food that is wasted.

Land use, water use, and eutrophication potential (corresponding to N fertilizer use) clearly have the bulk of their direct impacts from the production stage (Fig. 1-3). Greenhouse gas emissions are highest in agricultural production and in "other impacts" or indirect impacts that are not currently assigned to a single stage (Fig. 4). Almost all energy use is in the indirect or "other" category (Fig. 5); there is a discontinuity in the plot so that you can still see the difference in the other emissions values. I experimented with a log scale as well, but it looked misleading in the other direction so I opted for the broken axis.

Figure 6 shows the same data but only the "waste impacts" portion, grouped by impact category and transformed to a proportion, to visualize where the direct impacts are taking place. It shows that most direct impacts are from agricultural production except in energy use.

# Impacts by food type

I multiplied the FAO food type proportions assigned to each economic sector by the environmental impact contribution of that sector, then summed up the impacts by food type. This is a crude calculation of the total environmental impact assignable to each food type. I do not know how reliable this calculation is, but it could be interesting or thought-provoking. _*Note*_: This is the total impact of each food type, not the intensity of impact per unit production of the food type. It represents the total amount of resources consumed or impact generated by each food type in the USA.

As in the previous set of figures, the lighter shaded area represents the impacts due to waste, with the total bar height equal to the total impact.

The figures show that meat consumes the vast bulk of land (Fig. 7), as we might expect. Cereal crops (a huge agricultural industry) and fruit and vegetable crops use a lot of water (Fig. 8), although I would have expected meat to be just as high so perhaps this represents poor allocation of water use. Eutrophication potential via N fertilizer is concentrated in cereals (Fig. 9). Meat and cereals together represent the majority of GHG impacts (Fig. 10). Finally, crop plants consume a large amount of energy but meat and dairy industries are also fairly intense energy users (Fig. 11).
