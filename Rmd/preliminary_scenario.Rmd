# Description

This very quick and rough analysis shows how we might be able to model a proposed intervention to reduce food waste. The total environmental impacts of producing a given quantity of food in different food sectors are estimated using USEEIO. Then, the proportion of those embodied impacts that end up in food that is wasted somewhere along the supply chain is estimated using the rough method of multiplying those impacts by the total loss proportion across the entire supply chain provided by LAFA.

# Scenario

The proposed intervention in this case is to imagine replacing 50% of fresh fruit and fresh vegetable consumption in the USA with canned or frozen equivalents. Based on a quick summary of Nielsen HomeScan data provided by ERS (it is a 1999 source so the absolute numbers are probably outdated, but the relative difference in price should be the same), I estimated that per serving, buying processed fruit and vegetables is about 1.67 times more expensive than fresh. The ratio is roughly the same for both fruits and vegetables. This is a rough number and may need to be revised later, but is probably defensible to use.

Next, I looked at the average waste proportions, across the entire supply chain, given by LAFA. This is necessarily a very crude number -- although LAFA has numbers for almost all fruits and vegetables, I used the average given for all fruit and all vegetables (I assume, but haven't checked, that this is a weighted average by total quantity of each fruit/veg). Because the USEEIO model only includes a single sector including all canned and frozen produce, I had to average those as well. Below are the numbers I used. The first 6 rows are LAFA values and the last 4 are numbers I calculated. The weighting between fruits and vegetables is based on the USEEIO demand numbers and the weighting between canned and frozen is based on the per capita availability in LAFA.

Food type                                        | Percent wasted across all levels
-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------
Fresh fruit                                      | 62.7%
Fresh vegetables                                 | 54.5%
Canned fruit                                     | 33.8%
Canned vegetables                                | 63.6%
Frozen fruit                                     | 36.6%
Frozen vegetables                                | 60.8%
Canned and frozen fruit (weighted average)       | 34.4%
Canned and frozen vegetables (weighted average)  | 61.6%
Canned and frozen produce (weighted average)     | 47.1%
Fresh produce (weighted average)                 | 58.9%

As you can see from the table, canned and frozen fruit are wasted much less than fresh (34.4/62.7 = 0.55), but averaging across canned and frozen vegetables the processed vegetables are actually wasted more than fresh ones (61.6/54.5 = 1.13). We can already see that processing more fruit, therefore wasting less, can provide a net benefit despite the additional resources used in processing, but processing vegetables will both have greater impact and produce more waste, so it is unlikely to be beneficial. However combining fruits and vegetables, overall, canned and frozen are wasted less than fresh (47.1% versus 58.9%).

I took the total US consumption data for 2007 for fresh fruit, fresh vegetables, and the total canned/frozen fruit and vegetable sector, given in dollar values eventually converted to 2013 CPI by the USEEIO model assembly procedure. For the alternative scenario, I divided the fresh fruit and vegetable consumption amounts by 2. Then I increased the canned/frozen fruit/vegetable sector by the total amount removed from the other two sectors, multiplied by 1.5 to assume servings are constant, and multiplied by the waste ratios given above.

In 2007, the total demand for fresh fruit, fresh vegetables, and preserved produce was about \$69.4 billion (in 2013 USD), and the alternative scenario with decreased demand for fresh and increased demand for preserved overall causes an increase of demand by \$7.5 billion, to \$76.9 billion.

I calculated the total environmental impacts in the energy, GHG, land, and water categories for each of the sectors under the baseline and alternative scenarios. In addition, I looked at the impact on jobs and value-added processing that would be generated by the requirement to produce more canned and frozen fruits and vegetables.

Figure 1 shows the proportional difference in total impact from the baseline.

\caption{Difference in impact from increasing canned and frozen fruit and vegetable consumption}
\end{figure}

In Figure 1 you can see that the energy used to produce the canned and frozen food goes up by over 30% in the alternative scenario relative to the baseline, and the GHG emissions go up by about 15%. Land used increases slightly, and the water footprint is actually 30% less. There is a positive economic impact due to the increased processing activity.

# Food waste by scenario

Next, I took the very crude step of multiplying the impact results by the LAFA proportions of food lost across all levels, by category. This is admittedly a very rough way of doing it especially given the very aggregated weighted average, but it should account for the fact that processed vegetables are wasted at a slightly higher rate, while processed fruit is wasted at a much lower rate.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{/Users/qread/Dropbox/projects/foodwaste/Results/waste_proportion_by_scenario.png}}
\caption{Difference in total and wasted impacts from increasing canned and frozen fruit and vegetable consumption}
\end{figure}

The result shows that the modest reduction in waste is not really enough to offset the increased energy and GHG inputs (the light-shaded regions in Figure 2). For energy and GHG, more impacts are generated in total and in terms of impacts generated to produce wasted food. For land, the amount used is roughly the same although it is used slightly more efficiently. The water footprint is less both in total and in terms of waste.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{/Users/qread/Dropbox/projects/foodwaste/Results/wasteonly_by_scenario.png}}
\caption{Difference in wasted impacts from increasing canned and frozen fruit and vegetable consumption}
\end{figure}

Figure 3 shows only the "lost" proportion from Figure 2 to emphasize the differences in waste. The total amount of energy and GHG embodied in food that is wasted increases, while the amount of land and water embodied in wasted food decreases.

# Conclusion

Overall, I would argue from this preliminary analysis that it does not seem like it would generate much benefit to convert 50% of fresh fruit and vegetable servings in the USA to preserved equivalents. Less water is both used and wasted, but more energy is used and GHG emitted. Land is used slightly more efficiently but slightly more overall. A positive benefit would be the increased economic activity created.

Things I need to do to improve this result, and my confidence in it, include:

* Including estimates of uncertainty
* Getting better numbers for the cost ratio per serving between canned, frozen, and fresh produce types
* Dividing up waste by stage (processor, retailer, consumer) so that we can account for the fact that less embodied resources are wasted, the earlier in the chain they are wasted
* If possible, disaggregating by fruit and vegetable type in the I/O model since we have separate waste and price data for all of them already

The last two points may require a more sophisticated version of the USEEIO model that we don't yet have access to.
