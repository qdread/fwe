# Description

These are some high-level figures that compare four food waste reduction interventions:

* consumer education campaigns
* spoilage prevention packaging
* standardized date labeling
* waste tracking and analytics (WTA) software

The interventions are compared on three metrics:

* total cost of implementation (Figure 1)
* net environmental impacts averted (Figure 2)
* cost per unit environmental impact averted (Figure 3)
* environmental impact averted per dollar spent, or cost-effectiveness (Figure 4 &mdash; inverse of Figure 3)

For now, this document mainly just contains the final results. I am working on documenting all the methods, assumptions, and other details for each of the interventions.

# Results

The total cost (Fig. 1) and the net impact averted (Fig. 2) are assuming that the intervention is implemented to the extent practicable. For consumer education campaigns, that is all metropolitan areas in the United States (totaling over 80% of the population). For spoilage prevention packaging, that is the food categories identified by ReFED as amenable to the intervention (I have the results separated out by food group but they aren't shown here). For standardized date labeling, it is all food. For waste tracking and analytics software, it is all food purchased by contracted foodservice operations of any size, and by restaurants operated by companies with at least 20 employees (large enough to afford the system). *Note*: The costs shown in Figure 1, 3, and 4 are a sum of annual costs and one-time costs to start the intervention, annualized over 5 years assuming 7% interest rate.

The net impact averted (Fig. 2) is the gross impact averted by reduction of food waste leading to decreased requirement of food production, minus the impact created by the intervention itself. In most cases the offsetting impact is a fairly small percentage. (I also have results for the gross impact versus net impact but they aren't shown here). The offsetting impact that makes the most difference is the energy input required to produce the plastic material in the spoilage prevention packaging; this leads to spoilage prevention packaging having a disproportionately low cost-effectiveness for energy use.

On all the plots, the error bars represent a fairly conservative estimate of uncertainty so they are pretty wide.

The standardized date labeling intervention assumes 100% coordination (any adjustments to packaging machinery or design are made concurrently with other changes that would have been made anyway). This assumes that there is a negligible environmental impact of implementing the intervention. There are still costs associated with it, but they are all labor costs with no additional materials costs.

The waste tracking and analytics scenario is split up into 3 industry groups: contracted foodservice, full-service restaurants, and limited-service restaurants. This is informative because the total and relative costs are very different for each group. I also show the total when adding the three groups.

# Comments

The total cost of the consumer education campaigns is relatively low, even with the increased frequency. Possibly try to find other sources of cost data than just the King County, WA data?

There are some trade-offs with the total impact averted by category (Fig. 2). I think the spoilage prevention packaging uses a fair amount of energy to produce the packaging, so you get a slightly worse return in terms of energy, than for the other categories.

For the relative costs (Fig. 3, Fig. 4), the interventions are more or less comparable except that we get high relative costs  for the restaurant groups in waste tracking and analytics (it's more efficient to install WTA systems in larger foodservice operations, because the amount of food waste prevented by a single WTA system installed in a restaurant is much less than a system installed in a large foodservice kitchen. Maybe if you limited WTA systems in restaurants to really large establishments you could get a similar cost.) Standardized date labeling (due to low cost) and waste tracking systems in institutions with contracted foodservice operations (due to high reduction potential) have a fairly good cost-effectiveness (Fig. 4) for most categories.

# Comparison of results to other studies

## Comparison to ReFED

There are a few academic studies that try to cost out some of these interventions, but probably the most prominent point of comparison would be the economic analysis done by [ReFED](www.refed.com). I pulled the numbers from ReFED's analysis, so that we can compare our results with theirs for the four interventions for the following:

* total greenhouse gas emissions reduction potential (Fig. 5)
* total water use reduction potential (Fig. 6)
* total annual cost of implementing the intervention (Fig. 7)
* cost-effectiveness of greenhouse gas reduction (Fig. 8)
* cost-effectiveness of water use reduction (Fig. 9)

In Figures 5-9, the solid circles with uncertainty bars are our results, and the hollow circles are the ReFED results.

![Water use reduction cost-effectiveness compared to ReFED results](C:\Users\qread\Dropbox\Q\projects\foodwaste\Results\four_interventions_vsrefed_water_costeff.png){ width=50% }

The most notable results here are that ReFED is uniformly more optimistic in terms of the total cost of adopting the intervention everywhere practicable. This is especially true for WTA software and consumer education campaigns. However, we estimate that much more GHG emissions will be reduced by implementing WTA and spoilage prevention, compared to ReFED's estimate. Our GHG estimates are much closer for standardized date labeling and consumer education. Due to these discrepancies, the cost-effectiveness of GHG reduction is estimated by us to be much lower for date labeling changes and consumer education, higher for packaging changes, and fairly close for WTA (between our estimates for restaurants and contractors which makes sense). When it comes to water use, our results are a lot more pessimistic for cost-effectiveness, and generally lower for total water use reduced.

### Possible reasons for mismatch between our results and ReFED

The discrepancies are probably due to (1) differences in methodology (input-output model to find impacts versus ReFED's LCA-based approach &mdash; see below, and whatever idiosyncrasies of the USEEIO model are baked into our methods), (2) ReFED likely being overly optimistic about costs or not fully accounting for some of the costs, and (3) somewhat different assumptions about the effectiveness of the interventions, or what percent of waste they may reduce. We did adopt some of ReFED's assumptions but not others.

ReFED's approach to calculating the GHG reduction due to food waste reduction is based on a life-cycle assessment (LCA) study, specifically Heller and Keoleian (2015, Journal of Industrial Ecology; cited in ReFED's technical appendix document on pp. 54-55). The Heller study did a meta-analysis of published LCA studies to get GHG emissions of many individual food items. ReFED averaged these into their five main food categories (grain, meat, fruit&veg, seafood, dairy). This is a "bottom-up" approach starting with individual food types and aggregating, whereas the I-O method is a "top-down" approach. The LCA approach has to draw a tighter boundary in terms of which emissions are accounted for, so that might be why they have somewhat lower estimates for GHG. Another difference is that ReFED specifically accounts for GHG emissions avoided from gases emitted when wasted food is landfilled and decays. This would increase their estimates of GHG avoided, but theirs are still much lower than ours.

For water use, ReFED's estimates are based on crop and livestock water footprint data from the Water Footprint Network (Mekonnen & Hoekstra 2010, cited in the technical appendix on p. 56). The underlying method there is a fairly sophisticated material flow analysis, which draws on many data sources primarily FAOSTAT. Our estimates for total water conserved are sometimes higher than ReFED's and sometimes lower, with differences probably mainly due to differences in estimates for how much waste is reduced.

## Comparison to "McKinsey curve"

A well-known analysis was done by McKinsey in 2007 to generate an abatement cost curve for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (Fig. 10). The analysis is a little bit out of date but the general trend should still hold. The two dimensions determining the optimal emissions-reducing measure to take are the total amount of emissions reduced, and the net cost (or net savings) from taking the action. Actions with a small overall emissions reduction potential are only worth taking if there is a net savings, while actions that are very expensive can be justified if there is a very large reduction potential. I was curious if the food waste CO<sub>2</sub> abatement curve also followed this pattern (Fig. 11).

I calculated the net cost for our food waste interventions (Fig. 11) in a crude way: subtracting $50 per ton (the societal benefit of reducing a ton of emissions) from the relative cost. We see that two of our interventions (spoilage prevention packaging and WTA in contracted foodservice establishments) have a net savings, but the per unit cost is cheaper for the larger-scale interventions. This makes sense from an economy of scale perspective. It is also important to note that GHG emissions reduction is just one of the many benefits of food waste reduction so the net cost may be much lower for all the interventions. On the other hand, any job or revenue losses are not currently accounted for either, so that would add to the net cost.

A final thing to note is that these interventions are on a much smaller scale than the interventions shown on the McKinsey curve, which range up to ~3 GT emissions abated, while our largest-scale intervention is ~0.03 GT abated. This does not jibe that well with the messaging that food waste reduction is a major component of GHG emissions reduction, so we will have to discuss that further.

# To do

* ~~We still need to standardize everything to 2012 dollars.~~
* ~~Note that all costs are either annual costs, or if one-time costs, annualized over 5 years at 7% interest.~~
* ~~The spoilage prevention packaging may not be the most up-to-date result with all eligible food groups included. (Get rid of seafood, add in vegetables?)~~
* ~~Consumer education campaigns should be modeled as being more frequent (6x and 12x instead of 1x and 2x yearly) which will increase the costs.~~
* ~~Probably get rid of the 0% coordination since that is a fairly unlikely scenario.~~
* Check over all other assumptions and confirm validity.
* The uncertainty given here is very crude, do a more refined job with it.
* Look into what journal(s) to consider submitting.

# Change log

* **30 March 2020** add results comparing to ReFED results, as well as the figure comparing to a McKinsey style abatement cost curve.
