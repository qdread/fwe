# Summary

**What?** Building on the analysis already done for waste tracking & analytics systems, this presents our estimates of total costs and net environmental benefits for multiple food loss/waste (FLW) reduction interventions if adopted uniformly across the United States.

The interventions compared here are:

* Waste tracking and analytics
* Consumer education campaigns
* Intelligent packaging (WIP)
* Packaging size adjustment/optimization (WIP)
* Date labeling standardization (WIP)

**How?** The data on the cost of implementation are based on a combination of structured interviews with industry practitioners and a number of assumptions we made based on different sources of information. Baseline food waste rates are derived from USDA LAFA data, converted from mass units to monetary units. The monetary value of food waste averted by the intervention is estimated from the baseline waste rate and some assumptions about the percent reduction in the waste rate if the intervention is implemented. Then we use the USEEIO input-output model to get the environmental impact reduction based on the value of food production averted by the hypothetical intervention. Finally, we also use the USEEIO model to estimate the additional environmental impact generated by the intervention itself, given the value of the infrastructure and/or equipment needed to implement (also derived from the cost data). The final results are the total cost and net environmental benefit of the intervention, as well as the cost per unit reduction of a variety of environmental impacts.
