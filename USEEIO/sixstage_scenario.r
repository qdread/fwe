# Draft code for new scenario analysis (FWE)
# Six possible parameters for reduction
# QDR / FWE / 29 May 2019

# reduction areas: agriculture, processing, retail, institutional consumption, food service consumption, household consumption

# Run "grid" scenario 6 ways ----------------------------------------------

# Use 5 levels of reduction for each sector. 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%
# 5 levels of reduction in 6 sectors = 5^6 scenarios = 15625

# Load the data.


# Do optimization for different impact categories -------------------------

# For now, use fake abatement cost curves to test and make sure it works.
